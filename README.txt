    - We used this code as a base and adapted the files to support many pages through the use of handlebars. While using this code, we changed
    many aspects, such as the ways the user can interact with the page (buttons, input boxes, and drop downs). In addition, we altered much of the
    SQL integration in the to match our needs and user inputs. 

    - This resource was the only one which we took inspiration from, all other aspects of the project are original, including the 
    SQL files and additional code which we added to the previously stated files.
